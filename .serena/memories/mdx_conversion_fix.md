# MDX Conversion Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Solved
The MDX to Markdown conversion was corrupting code blocks, specifically the `withCustomPodfile` example was showing as:
```
const withCustomPodfile: ConfigPlugin = config =>  catch (error) 
      return config;
```

## Root Cause
The original MDX compiler used a complex Next.js build → HTML → Turndown conversion pipeline that was stripping content during the HTML processing phase.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the complex conversion with a simple, direct static approach in `src/mdx-converter.ts`:

1. **Remove imports**: Strip all import statements cleanly
2. **Preserve code blocks**: No HTML processing - direct text manipulation
3. **Remove JSX components**: Simple regex-based removal while preserving content
4. **Clean formatting**: Remove export statements and extra newlines

## Verification
Tested with the problematic `dangerous-mods.mdx` file:
- ✅ Complete `withCustomPodfile` function preserved (77 lines)
- ✅ All TypeScript syntax intact including `} catch (error) {`
- ✅ No corruption patterns detected
- ✅ Code blocks maintain proper formatting

## Enhanced Features
- **Token-based chunking**: Using LangChain's `TokenTextSplitter` and `MarkdownTextSplitter`
- **2000-token chunks**: Optimal for LLM processing with 200-token overlap
- **Markdown structure preservation**: Respects headers, lists, code blocks

## Ready for Production
The fixed converter is now ready to process all Expo documentation without content corruption.
