`expo-navigation-bar` enables you to modify and observe the native navigation bar on Android devices. Due to some Android platform restrictions, parts of this API overlap with the `expo-status-bar` API.

Properties are named after style properties; visibility, position, backgroundColor, borderColor, and so on.

The APIs in this package have no impact when "Gesture Navigation" is enabled on the Android device. There is currently no native Android API to detect if "Gesture Navigation" is enabled or not.
