**EAS Hosting** is a service for quickly deploying your web projects built using [Expo Router](/router/introduction/) and React Native web. It seamlessly integrates with the Expo CLI, allowing you to automate the deployment of API routes, server functions, and server-side assets.

Hosting offers the fastest path from `npx create-expo-app` to a fully deployed web app with API routes and server functions.
