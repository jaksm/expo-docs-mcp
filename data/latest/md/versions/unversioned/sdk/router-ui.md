`expo-router/ui` is a submodule of `expo-router` library and exports components and hooks to build custom tab layouts, rather than using the default [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) navigators provided by `expo-router`.

> See the [Expo Router](./router) reference for more information about the file-based routing library for native and web app.

## Installation

To use `expo-router/ui` in your project, you need to install `expo-router` in your project. Follow the instructions from the Expo Router's installation guide:

## Configuration in app config

If you are using the [default](/more/create-expo/#--template) template to create a new project, `expo-router` [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) is automatically configured in the app config automatically.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["expo-router"]
  }
}
```
