**EAS Submit** is a hosted service for submitting your app binaries to the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

It makes submitting your apps simple and easy by creating and handling submission credentials and running the submission process. You can trigger a submission from a CLI command, after a build is finished, or from a CI/CD service. It's the fastest way to take Android and iOS builds and submit them to the app stores.
